## 🙋 Why I Built This

> “I love reading, but always struggled to decide which book to read next. Most lists online are cluttered or sponsored. I wanted a clean, no-noise platform where I (and others like me) can find genuinely helpful books — fast.”

## 💡 Inspiration Behind the Name

We chose **FindYourBook** instead of **FindMyBook** to keep it user-centric. It's not just about me — it's about helping *you* find *your* next great book.
